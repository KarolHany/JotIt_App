/*
 => in this app i leaned :
    1- use bloc very well
    2- use hive to store the notes
    3- refactor my code that make it very easy and understand to read
    4- => new widgets :
         - BlocObserver : can hook into lifecycle events of your Blocs/Cubits
         - showDatePicker: display date that you need when you choose the first date and last date
         - showModalBottomSheet: displays a modal sheet from the bottom of the screen
         - AbsorbPointer: can block touch events for its child and prevent any interaction with the child widget
    5- the diffrent between BlocBuilder , BlocListener ,  BlocConsumer and BlocProvider
